Lectures for Management and Analysis of Physics Datasets course MSc in Physic of Data at University of Padua 2021-2022.

This fork contains both the professor's notebooks and my personal code written on top of them. The main topics are:
- Management of relational databases with MySql (using Python interface)
- Distributed computing with Spark, Dask, Kafka (using Python interface)

The final project on distributed processing is in the repository [Koln Traffic Regulator with Parallel Computing](https://github.com/PaoloZinesi/Koln_Traffic_Regulator_with_Parallel_Computing).
